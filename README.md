## Steps to run the app

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project using **Xcode**.
3. Resolve Swift Package dependencies (if needed).
4. Select a simulator or a physical device.
5. Run the project using **Cmd + R**.

---

## What areas of the app did you focus on?

I focused mainly on:

* Building a clean and scalable architecture (MVVM).
* Implementing API communication and data flow.
* Creating a simple, readable, and maintainable UI.
* Writing unit tests for core business logic.

---

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?

The main goal was to demonstrate strong fundamentals in iOS development, such as separation of concerns, testability, and clean code. I aimed to solve common problems like tightly coupled views, hard-to-test logic, and unclear data flow by applying MVVM and clear abstractions.

---

## How long did you spend on this project?

Approximately **20–25 hours**, including planning, development, and testing. I would also like to highlight that part of this time was dedicated to research, understanding the product, and prototyping to make the development process more efficient and practical.

---

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?

Yes. Due to time constraints:

* The UI was kept intentionally simple.
* Error handling and edge cases could be expanded.
* UI tests were not implemented.
* I would work more deeply on UI components and their reusability.
* I would write more unit tests.

With more time, I would improve visual polish, add UI tests, and enhance accessibility and error/loading states.

---

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

The weakest part is the UI refinement and user feedback for error and loading states, which could be more detailed and visually expressive. Another area I found challenging was testing: although I am able to implement tests, it requires more time to carefully design the logic. This is something I have been continuously improving through practice.

---

## Is there any other information you’d like us to know?

One point I would like to highlight is the prototyping phase. I spent a significant amount of time analyzing the Bipa app to better understand how the UI is structured and how you approach a clean, Apple-native design style. Below is the link to the prototype I created during this process:

Additionally, I used AI tools to help with code documentation. Since English is not my first language, this allowed me to write clearer and more consistent documentation while saving a significant amount of time. This helped me focus more on architecture, implementation, and overall code quality.
